        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        The rapid growth of research publications in Computer

        <span class="sidenote">In 2024, there were more than 20'000 submitted papers to ECCV and CVPR only. Slightly
            over
            5'000 papers were accepted to both conferences combined, making it impossible for a single person to keep up
            with all the research that is happening.</span>
        and Artificial Intelligence makes staying
        updated a daunting task. To address this, I developed a tool that automates the discovery and filtering of
        research papers from sources like Arxiv. This tool leverages fine-tuned language models, human feedback, and
        keyword relevance to streamline paper curation, ensuring that only the most relevant works reach the curious
        user. This article outlines the technical process behind building the tool, including data ingestion, model
        fine-tuning, and feedback integration, offering insights into how AI can simplify the research workflow.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            The flood of daily publications in Computer Vision and AI poses a challenge for anyone wanting to consume
            research:
            identifying valuable insights without spending hours sifting through papers. Traditional
            keyword or author searches often miss nuanced context or fail to adapt to evolving interests and can miss
            relevant papers.

            such as litmap, semantics
            scolar or connected papers fall short if it's about the most recent research.
            I aimed to solve this by creating a system that not only automates the selection process
            but also learns from user preferred topics. By combining AI-driven filtering with human feedback loops, this
            tool empowers a user to focus on innovation rather than information overload.
