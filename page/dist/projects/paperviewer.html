        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">In 2024, there were more than 20'000 submitted papers to ECCV and CVPR only. Slightly
            over
            5'000 papers were accepted to both conferences combined, making it impossible for a single person to keep up
            with all the research that is happening.</span>
        and Artificial Intelligence makes staying
        updated a daunting task. To address this, I developed a tool that automates the discovery and filtering of
        research papers from sources like
        <label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number">Arxiv</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">
            See full list of possible sources in Apendix A-I.
        </span>
        . This tool leverages fine-tuned language models, human feedback, and
        keyword relevance to streamline paper curation, ensuring that only the most relevant works reach the curious
        user. This article outlines the technical process behind building the tool, including data ingestion, model
        fine-tuning, and feedback integration, offering insights into how AI can simplify the research workflow.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                The flood of daily publications in Computer Vision and AI poses a challenge for anyone wanting to
                consume
                research:
                identifying valuable insights without spending hours sifting through papers. Traditional
                keyword or author searches often miss nuanced context or fail to adapt to evolving interests and can
                miss
                relevant papers.
                <label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number">Tools</label>

                such as litmap, semantics
                scolar or connected papers fall short if it's about the most recent research.
                I aimed to solve this by creating a system that not only automates the selection process
                but also learns from user preferred topics. By combining AI-driven filtering with human feedback loops,
                this
                tool empowers a user to focus on innovation rather than information overload.
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            The system consists of four main components (as seen in Fig. 1):
            <ul>
                <li>Paper Database</li>
                <li>Paper Scraper</li>
                <li>Learned Paper Curator</li>
                <li>User Facing Application</li>
            </ul>
            In the following paragraph, each of those parts whill be
            detailed followed by more detailed insights into
            the sources, scoring and learning details.
            </p>

            <p><br><b>Paper Database</b><br>
                Such that the whole process is independent from any external sources, I decided to have my own paper
                database which stores the needed paper meta-information as well as a link to the pdf. This allows for
                easy ingestion of new papers as well as checking if the same paper has already been ingested, if it
                appears in multiple sources. Lastly, it allows for custom meta data which is important for tagging and
                training.<br>
                <br><b>Paper Scraper</b><br>
                The paper scraper is responsible for finding and ingesting all new research publications from different
                sources online. The scraper has been designed to be as flexible as possible allowing all possible
                sources to be ingested. For now, only sources with a clean Python-API have been incorporated, namely
                Arxiv and Google Scholar.<br>
