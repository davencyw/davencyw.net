        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The rapid growth of research publications in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence makes staying
            updated a daunting task. To address this, I developed a tool that automates the discovery and filtering of
            research papers from sources like Arxiv. This tool leverages fine-tuned language models, human feedback, and
            keyword relevance to streamline paper curation, ensuring that only the most relevant works reach the user.
            This article outlines the technical process behind building the tool, including data ingestion, model
            fine-tuning, and feedback integration, offering insights into how AI can simplify the research workflow.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            The deluge of daily publications in Computer Vision and AI poses a challenge for researchers and
            practitioners: identifying valuable insights without spending hours sifting through papers. Traditional
            keyword searches often miss nuanced context or fail to adapt to evolving interests. I aimed to solve this by
            creating a system that not only automates the selection process but also learns from user preferences. By
            combining AI-driven filtering with human feedback loops, this tool empowers researchers to focus on
            innovation rather than information overload.
