                        <h2>About Me</h2> </br>
                        <p>
                            I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer with a deep passion for creating cutting-edge solutions in
                            computer vision, real-time AI systems, and scalable deep learning applications. With a
                            strong foundation in advanced algorithm design and optimization, I have honed my
                            expertise
                            in bridging state-of-the-art research with practical, production-ready systems. My
                            career is
                            defined by a drive to solve complex challenges while fostering innovation and
                            collaboration
                            within diverse teams.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, I have successfully led cross-functional teams, guiding the development of
                            sub-second human skeletal pose tracking systems, multi-modal human skeleton pose
                            optimization, and
                            action recognition pipelines. These projects required not only strong technical expertise
                            but also a meticulous focus on building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance
                            software. I take pride in delivering robust solutions that integrate seamlessly into
                            production environments, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and long-term value.

                        <p>
                            With over 10 years of experience in C++ and Python, I am proficient in a wide range of
                            tools
                            and libraries, including high-performance computing frameworks (OpenMP, BLAS, Eigen,
                            Ceres,
                            Boost, TBB), GPGPU programming (CUDA, CuDNN), and deep learning frameworks (PyTorch,
                            OpenCV,
                            numpy, pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, scipy). My expertise extends to orchestration tools
                            such
                            as Union/Flyte and MLflow, which I leverage to streamline development, enable
                            reproducibility, and ensure scalability in AI workflows.

                            Equally comfortable in high-pressure startup environments and structured organizations,
                            I
                            excel at taking ownership of projects from concept to deployment. Whether optimizing
                            inference pipelines with TensorRT or developing custom CUDA kernels for
                            performance-critical
                            tasks, my work reflects a commitment to quality, precision, and innovation.

                        <h2>My Motivation</h2> </br>
                        <p>
                            At the core of my work is a passion for transforming state-of-the-art research into
